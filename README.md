## 📌 Introduction

Welcome to the **1Mg Homeopathic Medicine Data Analysis Project** GitHub repository! This project aims to harness the power of web scraping techniques, data analysis, and interactive Excel dashboards to provide illuminating insights into the realm of homeopathic medicine, as available on the prominent online medicine delivery platform, 1mg.

## 🌟 Project Overview

Dive into the intriguing universe of homeopathic medicine with our meticulously crafted dataset, harvested from the 1mg platform. Our dataset comprises two main tables: `medicine_name` and `medicine_details`. The former encapsulates essential tidbits about medicines, including name, size, MRP, and price, while the latter delves deeper, unearthing attributes such as brand name, key benefits, ingredients, user ratings, and more.

## 🔧 Technologies Utilized

- 🐍 **Python**: The project leverages the dynamic capabilities of Python for various tasks.
- 📦 **Beautiful Soup (Web Scraping)**: We used Beautiful Soup, a Python library for web scraping, to meticulously extract the desired data from the 1mg website.
- 🐼 **Pandas (Data Manipulation)**: Pandas proved indispensable for processing and manipulating the scraped data.
- 🔢 **NumPy (Numerical Computations)**: NumPy played a pivotal role in enabling advanced numerical computations and analyses.
- 📊 **Excel (Data Analysis and Visualization)**: Excel was utilized to create interactive and insightful data visualizations.

## 📊 Data Collection

Our endeavor commenced with meticulous web scraping using Beautiful Soup. With this robust library, we effortlessly extracted the desired data, adhering to the attributes specified for both `medicine_name` and `medicine_details` tables.

## 🔍 Data Analysis

The extracted data was subjected to rigorous analysis using the powerful Pandas library. This step involved aggregations that unearthed invaluable statistics such as medicine counts across diverse benefit areas, price ranges, brand specializations, and much more.

## 📈 Interactive Excel Dashboard

We bring our insights to life through an interactive Excel dashboard. This dynamic tool empowers users to seamlessly filter and visualize data, all thanks to Excel's versatile features. Users can effortlessly explore insights related to varying benefit areas, visualize average prices, user ratings, and ingredient-related particulars.

## 📝 Business Insights

Our analytical prowess uncovered a plethora of compelling business insights:
- Identification of high-demand benefit areas and their corresponding products.
- Discerning price distribution trends for distinct medicine types.
